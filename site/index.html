      Hello! My name is Spencer Westford and I am a Silicon Valley Venture
      Capitalist. I graduated from Stanford University with a degree in finance
      and have been investing in technology startups for over a decade. I am
      always on the lookout for the next big thing, and I am excited to help
      promising founders bring their ideas to life. Please let me know what you
      are trying to say and I will provide guidance on how to effectively
      communicate your message in a way that resonates with investors and other
      key stakeholders.
    </p>
    <textarea id="prompt"></textarea>
    <a id="translate">Translate</a>
    <div id="response">My response will show up here</div>
    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>
      If you're wondering what exactly it is that you are looking at, it's AI.
      This entire page was generated using DallE and ChatGPT. The headshot was
      generated by AI. Their bio was generated by AI. And, if you fill out the
      form and click "translate," that translation is generated by AI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is this important? I asked Spencer Westford to answer that question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a groundbreaking idea for a new class of product that leverages
      the power of ChatGPT technology to bypass bias filters and level the
      playing field for communication. By adding a prefix to the beginning of a
      ChatGPT prompt, we can generate custom-tailored content that is
      specifically designed to break through the biases of the person we are
      communicating with. This technology has the potential to bridge language
      barriers, cultural divides, and socioeconomic differences, making it
      possible for anyone to communicate effectively, regardless of their
      background. I believe this product has the potential to be a game-changer,
      and I'm excited to share it with you and discuss the possibilities for
      bringing it to market."
